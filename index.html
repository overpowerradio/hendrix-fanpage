<div><h2>Bio:</h2></div>

<div><p><a id="com" href="http://www.jimihendrix.com" target=new window>Jimi Hendrix</a> <font class="black">[Born: November 27, 1942 /Rested: September 18, 1970] is celebrated as the greatest guitarist planet Earth has ever known. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music." You may have witnessed others perform in his likeness. If you've ever seen a guitarist play their guitar behind their back or pluck the guitar strings with their teeth, these are rock star antics first introduced to the world by Jimi Hendrix, the ultimate guitar hero.</font></p>

<br>
<p><font class="black">In his lifetime, he released three albums with his band, known as The Jimi Hendrix Experience. These 3 albums (Are You Experienced, Axis Bold As Love, & Electric Ladyland) embody his most popular hits like Purple Haze, Foxy Lady, Fire, The Wind Cries Mary, Hey Joe, and many others. He also released one other album with a different band, entitled "Hendrix: A Band of Gypsys." While this album doesn't have any well-known hits, it is the album I consider to be the hottest rock album on the planet - a bonified classic, for sure.</font>
